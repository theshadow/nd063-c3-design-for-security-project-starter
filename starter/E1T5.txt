Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

The EC2 instance for the Web Service is running in a 
public subnet. It should run within a private subnet.

The VPC should have ingress rules that block all traffic except for port 80.

# Poor practice 2

The EC2 instance for the web service should have a security group that only allowss ingress and egress traffic for port 5000s

The EC2 instance shouldn't allow SSH authentication with passswords.
