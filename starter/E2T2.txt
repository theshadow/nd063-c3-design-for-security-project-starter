The followig ports are open to ingress traffic for the projects VPC. I would resolve this by first declaring a DENY rule for all traffic and then selectively opening ports as needed. In the case of this project this would look like:

- *	All IPv4 traffic 	all All 0.0.0.0/0 	DENY
- *	All IPv4 traffic 	TCP 80 0.0.0.0/0 	ALLOW
